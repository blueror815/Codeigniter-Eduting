In most cases, you should be able to reapply to the visa-issuing office by submitting additional information.

                            One of the most important things you will have to care of before you start your studies in the United States is finding a place to live. This is an important decision since it will be one of your biggest expenses and will affect your personal and academic adjustment. All most all U.S. colleges and universities provide their students with the option to live in residence halls or dormitories. Usually there is a great demand for residence hall space, and it might not be easy to get a room. As soon as you receive your acceptance letter from your chosen school, return the housing application. An advance deposit may be required, At some colleges and universities, dormitory rooms are so much in demand that s lottery is held to determine who will be granted space.

                            One of the most attractive features of bachelor's degree program in the United States is that it is highly flexible. You can usually choose from a wide variety of course and create your own unique program of study. The degree is awarded after you complete a specified number of credits, which are usually completed in four years of full-time study. The first year is called the freshman year: the second is called sophomore: the third. junior: and the fourth, senior. You may read that students in the United States often take longer than four years complete their degrees. This maybe because they change majors and need to accumulate enough credits in the new major field to earn the degree. Or it may be because they take less than a full-time course load per term for academic, personal, or financial reasons. International students, however, cannot study part-time and must maintain full-time status.
